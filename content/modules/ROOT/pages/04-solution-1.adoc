.. Similarly add couple of more comments, one good and one bad so that we have more than 60% negative sentiments on grafana dashboard. Sample below to copy:
... Excellent T-Shirt to have.
... Waste of money. Do not buy this product as its over prized and not good.

.. You will see Thank You message once you submit your review. After a few seconds you will see that same message in the bottom of that product page as Customer review.

. Access the Grafana Dashboard to understand overall historical trend and customer sentiments.

.. Post the earlier 3 customer ormore comments, you will see dashboard with more negative sentiments (ensure that your comments resemble more negative sentiments to make this look more real).
This dashboard shows that the KPI (Key Performance Indicator of more than 60% positive sentiments is the ask from Product Manager) for GLOBEX Clothing Product Manager is not met and so the PM needs to do something to get the KPI of positive sentiments back to more than 60%. That is when a marketing strategy is evolved and data scientist team is roped in.
We will see how to challenge is overcome in next section.

. Before we move onto implementing the marketing strategy (in out next section) to improve the KPI for clothing product category, lets understand the technical aspects of how the above sentiment analysis works.
. Once a customer provides feedback via comments, it gets will pushed to kafka message queue and is picked up by intelligent sentiment analysis application to analyse the sentiment of this comment.
Once its analyzed, it will send the comment along with sentiment to another kafka message queue.
Note that there is another application running and which moderates the comments which are not using proper language or are abusive in nature. Those messages are then discarded.
This output is then moved to a Time Series InfluxDB database for storing the results for dashboard and historical purpose as well as to another database from where its visible back to the GLOBEX UI as customer comments.
Grafana then pull this data from influxdb database and provides you/management with graphical insights for data driven decision making capability.

.. There are 5 major namespaces which are used for sentiment analysis:

****
[upperalpha]

* *sentiment-analysis*:
** most of the microservices
** knative services, knative brokers, and  knative triggers
* *influxdb-project*:
** InfluxDB - a time series database
** Python based connector which reads from Kafka and pushes the content into InfluxDB
** Grafana dashboard
* *globex*: A number of fundamental microservices and database of the fictitious retail customer Globex, which are used in the our application, but aren't really impacting the Sentiment Analysis solution pattern
* *globex-mw*:
** Red Hat AMQ Streams (Apache Kafka)
** Kafdrop (a Kafka topic visualization tool)
* *rhsso*:
** Red Hat SSO based on Keycloak which manages the user login. You can find the password for the `admin` user within the Secret *credential-rhsso* within the *rhsso* namespace
****

.. Lets dig deeper into how this is implemented.

. Let us now trace the flow of the reviews across the various systems
.. Once you login to GLBOEX App UI as a customer and comment on a product (for e.g. we commented on cothing category - T-shirt above).
This review gets submitted to the *globex.reviews* kafka topic, which then gets picked up by the Intelligent App *aiml-moderate-reviews*
This service routes the reviews to either *reviews.moderated* topic or *reviews.denied* topic depending on whether review's language was acceptable or not

* You can view these topics through Kafkdrop. To access Kafdrop, navigate to *globex-mw* namespace, and launch kafdrop or you can click on the below link
* *Kafkadrop:* https://kafdrop-globex-mw.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[window=_blank]

* Filter the topics with the word *review* to see a list of relevant topics
+
image:reviews-topics.png[]
* Click on each of the topics to see the actual messages.
* This is the *reviews.moderated* topic. You will notice that the message is a JSON.
** What is even more interesting is the headers of this message *ce-type* and *ce-source*
** These headers are present because the messages are all managed as https://cloudevents.io/[Cloud Events^]. CloudEvents is a specification for describing event data in a common way.
