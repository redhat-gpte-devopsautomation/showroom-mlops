:navtitle: 3: Demo Red Hat OpenShift AI
:numbered:

== Understanding Red Hat OpenShift AI basic capabilities.

As a Red Hat Architect you are to demonstrate Red Hat OpenShift AI model serving and pipeline capabilities
to GLOBEX data scientist team so that they can move to RHOAI's new capabilities for their Model Serving requirments.

. Objectives :
.. Demonstrate OpenShift AI model serving capability
.. Demonstrate OpenShift AI pipeline capability

... TBD ...

We will demonstrate object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular object detection and image segmentation model,
to recognize specific objects in pictures, and how to deploy and use this model. This wil also help demonstrate RHOAI features.

We will start with Data Preparation following by Training and Model Serving. Finally we will see how to consume this model over gRPC or REST.

.. In this section, we will: * log into Red Hat OpenShift AI
* Create a Data Science Project
* Create a workbench of type pytorch in this project
* Clone the project from your a github instance
https://github.com/ritzshah/object-detection-model-serving-yolov5.git

... Logging into Red Hat OpenShift AI

* Red Hat OpenShift AI URL: {rhodh_dashboard}[window=_blank]
* Click on ``Log in with OpenShift''
* Log in as `user1` with the password `openshift`
* Click *Allow Selected Permissions* to Authorize the access
* Once in the Red Hat OpenShift AI Dashboard, Click on the *Data Science Projects and select create data science project*

Main OpenShiftAI Dashboard, select Data Science Projects
** image:data-science-project.png[Data Science Projects]

Create a Data Science Project called `object-detection-yolov5` as shown below:
** image:Create-data-scioence-project.png[Create data science project]

This will give you an empty Data Science Project of yolov5, the same is created in Openshift as a project as well.
You can check by login to openshift console and checking the project named `object-detection-yolov5`
