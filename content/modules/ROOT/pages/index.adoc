== Workshop Overview

This AI-based smart retail solution features a scalable and efficient architecture designed for image detection with specific business outcomes.

Explore how Red Hat OpenShift seamlessly integrates Machine Learning, CI/CD, and GitOps into a coherent development experience. Participants will delve into the capabilities of Jupyter Notebooks within the Red Hat OpenShift Data Science ecosystem, enabling dynamic adjustments to applications and models. The workshop will also spotlight the effectiveness of MLOps through Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines for intelligent application management. Concurrently, attendees will gain insights into GitOps practices, focusing on the role of Argo CD in maintaining application resilience. The workshop concludes with a department store scenario, illustrating the practical application of these technologies in a real-world setting to benefit both consumers and businesses.

Participants will also have the opportunity to explore and understand OpenShift AI features, particularly how model serving works and can be deployed, and how applications can leverage these new features.

This lab provides hands-on experience with sentiment analysis based on real customer feedback, using a fictitious retail company. In the final stages, we will explore how to weave a compelling narrative by combining this intelligent application for sentiment analysis with object detection using MLOps, contributing to the achievement of specific business goals. This approach allows you to present the demo to your customers, leading with a realistic use case to provide your perspective. You will also walk through various Red Hat components and their seamless integration to create a highly scalable event-driven architecture.

The workshop showcases an architecture that is scalable and efficient, capturing and responding to streaming data using Kafka as the streaming platform and AIML. With an Event-Driven Architecture, this system can seamlessly connect to and consume data from various systems, services, and data sources by responding to triggering events.

This architecture exemplifies how an Event-Driven Architecture, coupled with Red Hat AMQ Streams and OpenShift Serverless, can help build an intelligent system using the OpenShift Data Science platform to derive business insights and facilitate an event-driven workflow.
